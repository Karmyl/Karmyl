### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Karmyl/Karmyl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I am Karri and currently studying computer science at Karelia University of Applied Sciences. This Github account acts as my portfolio and because it contains
only projects made in teams, this file is made for clearing out what have i done in these projects.
